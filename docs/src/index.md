# Documentation for Manifolds.jl

## Summary

This repository contains various functionalities for doing analysis on manifold-valued diffusion processes.


## Features

Functionalities for the following submanifolds of ``\mathbb{R}^3`` are implemented

- Sphere
- Torus
- Paraboloid

The functionalities in this repositiory can be used to construct Brownian motion, possibly with drift, on the frame bundle of these manifolds through the Eels-Elworthy-Malliavin construction.
