# Manifolds
This repository contains code for simulations of diffusions and diffusion bridges on Riemannian manifolds

# Implementation of manifolds
Manifolds embedded in a Euclidean space are subtypes of the EmbeddedManifold type. Some typical examples such as the $2$-sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, the $2$-Torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ and the paraboloid are already implemented and accompanied with the following properties:
